## Output:
cenario 1: Designing a Mobile Health & Fitness Tracking App
1. Identifying and Writing Problem Statements

User Pain Points

Users have trouble staying consistent with workouts.

They lack motivation and accountability.

Existing apps are complex or overloaded with features.

Users want personalized routines but don’t know where to start.

Problem Statements (Template)

Busy working professionals need a way to maintain a consistent fitness routine because they lack time to plan and track exercises, which results in reduced motivation and poor fitness outcomes.

New fitness learners need a way to receive personalized workout guidance because generic fitness apps do not match their skill level, which results in confusion and early dropout.

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
Research Method	Why it is Suitable
User Interviews	Helps understand personal motivations, barriers, and daily routines.
Surveys	Can quickly gather data about workout habits from a larger group.
Usability Testing	To test prototype flow for simplicity and clarity.

Justification:
Since fitness behavior is emotional and habit-based, interviews help capture personal motivations. Surveys validate common patterns. Usability tests ensure the app does not feel complicated.
