## UX PROJECT SCENARIO 1:

Food Delivery App (Swiggy-style) – Improving Home & Tracking Screens

1. USER PAIN POINTS

Home screen is cluttered with many banners.

Quick reorder option is hidden.

Order tracking lacks clear real-time movement.

Support option is hard to find during an active order.


##2. PROBLEM STATEMENTS

Problem Statement 1

> Busy users need a way to track their delivery accurately in real time because the current tracking updates are slow or unclear, which results in frustration and lack of trust in the service.



Problem Statement 2

> Returning customers need a way to reorder meals quickly because the reorder feature is buried inside multiple menus, which results in increased time taken to place orders and drop-offs.

##3. APPROPRIATE RESEARCH METHODS

Method	Why It's Suitable

Usability Testing	Helps observe where users hesitate while navigating home screen & tracking.
Short In-App Survey	Collects feedback after delivery to measure satisfaction with tracking.


Justification:
Usability testing reveals real interaction pain points, while surveys give quantitative feedback on tracking accuracy and ease of reordering.
